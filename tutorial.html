        <h2>So what is rpsxo?</h2>
        <p>rpsxo is shorthand for Rock Paper Scissors Tic Tac Toe.</p>
        <p>So what does that mean exactly? Simple! Just regular tic tac toe,</p>
        <h4 class="bigspace">but instead of placing X's and O's, you're placing rock, paper, scissors.</h4>
        <p>The goal is still the same: get three of the same thing in a line.</p>
        <p>However, now you can change items on the grid, with RPS rules (R>S, P>R, S>P)</p>
        <p>Also, ownership is disregarded, meaning that any tile can be used by any player for a win.</p>
        <h3 class="bigspace">Is this really that complicated?</h3>
        <p>Short answer: yes. Slightly less short answer: the number of possible board paths does not fit in a js array.</p>
        <p>Once you play the game, you discover how that the 3x3 grid provides ridiculously complicated challenges.</p>
        <p>seriously, for such a small game, you will not believe how strategic it can get.</p>
        <p>apparently the bot can't either, as I tried for hours on end to get a proper engine to work perfectly. without luck.</p>
        <h2 class="bigspace">Ready to play?</h2>
        <p>You can head directly to Ranked and try your luck.</p>
        <strong>NOTE: RANKED NOT YET IMPLEMENTED LOLLLLLLL</strong>
        <p>If you still need to get the hang of it, go to Casual Play and set bot skill to 1.</p>
        <p>Anyway, that's it for the tutorial. Now go rpsxo or smth idk</p>
