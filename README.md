# rpsxo (rock paper scissors tic tac toe)
its just... tic tac toe... but with rock paper scissors...

## ok stop fooling around what does this mean
so you have a 3x3 grid, placing down rock, paper, or scissors. match any 3 in a line to win. Easy? cool. Don't understand yet? Great! there is a tutorial page waiting just for you.

## why does this have so much aura
I know you're not asking this. Next question

## why does this look so fried
because it is! it's unfinished as hell!!!!! blame that on stupid rockfish (get it? rockfish? stockfish? rock paper scissors??? ugh) 

anyway yeah that poor old thing never worked properly. keeps inventing new strategies to win which is cool and all until it gets to the part where it starts needing to be consistent so I can make an analysis page and it falls flatter than my grades after doing siege

## well are you gonna try to make it better
if the themes work enough and I don't have better ideas.. keep your eyes on this bad boy it'll beat chess.com sooner rather than later
